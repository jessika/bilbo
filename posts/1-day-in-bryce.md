Here's how I spent 1 day in Bryce Canyon National Park. See how I spent the rest of my Utah trip in [my post about Zion National Park](/posts/2-days-in-zion).

## Itinerary

With only one day here, I debated whether to do shorter hikes and see more areas in the park, or to do a longer hike and less areas in the park. I decided to do a longer hike because I find that the view is more rewarding during the course of a long hike. I hiked the Fairyland Loop Trail and then drove to Bryce Point for a scenic view.

## Fairyland Loop Trail

This is a long hike. It's an 8-mile loop that takes you both into and along the rim of Fairyland Canyon. The view is otherworldly; walking among the giant hoodoos and desert landscape feels unreal.

## Bryce Point

The view at Bryce Point is mind-boggling. It overlooks a huge canyon with an extremely dense concentration of hoodoos.

## Getting here

The drive from Hurricane, the town I was staying in near Zion National Park, to Bryce Canyon is 2.5 hours. It's very scenic with a lot of long 2-lane roads. Gas stations are plentiful, with prices much cheaper than California.
